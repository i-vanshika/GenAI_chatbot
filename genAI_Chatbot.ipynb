Applications are often internationalized to display messages and output in a variety of user-selectable languages; the same program might need to output an error message in English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, or Russian. Web content can be written in any of these languages and can also include a variety of emoji symbols. Python’s string type uses the Unicode Standard for representing characters, which lets Python programs work with all these different possible characters. Unicode (https://www.unicode.org/) is a specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code. The Unicode specifications are continually revised and updated to add new languages and symbols. A character is the smallest possible component of a text. ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, etc., are all different characters. So are ‘È’ and ‘Í’. Characters vary depending on the language or context you’re talking about. For example, there’s a character for “Roman Numeral One”, ‘Ⅰ’, that’s separate from the uppercase letter ‘I’. They’ll usually look the same, but these are two different characters that have different meanings. The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by code points. A code point value is an integer in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF (about 1.1 million values, the actual number assigned is less than that). In the standard and in this document, a code point is written using the notation U+265E to mean the character with value 0x265e (9,822 in decimal). The Unicode standard contains a lot of tables listing characters and their corresponding code points: 0061 'a'; LATIN SMALL LETTER A 0062 'b'; LATIN SMALL LETTER B 0063 'c'; LATIN SMALL LETTER C ... 007B '{'; LEFT CURLY BRACKET ... 2167 'Ⅷ'; ROMAN NUMERAL EIGHT 2168 'Ⅸ'; ROMAN NUMERAL NINE ... 265E '\u0000'; BLACK CHESS KNIGHT 265F '\u0000'; BLACK CHESS PAWN ... 1F600 '\u0000'; GRINNING FACE 1F609 '\u0000'; WINKING FACE ... Strictly, these definitions imply that it’s meaningless to say ‘this is character U+265E’. U+265E is a code point, which represents\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 3:\n",
      "some particular character; in this case, it represents the character ‘BLACK CHESS KNIGHT’, ‘♞’. In informal contexts, this distinction between code points and characters will sometimes be forgotten. A character is represented on a screen or on paper by a set of graphical elements that’s called a glyph. The glyph for an uppercase A, for example, is two diagonal strokes and a horizontal stroke, though the exact details will depend on the font being used. Most Python code doesn’t need to worry about glyphs; figuring out the correct glyph to display is generally the job of a GUI toolkit or a terminal’s font renderer. 2 1.2 Encodings To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code points, which are numbers from 0 through 0x10FFFF (1,114,111 decimal). This sequence of code points needs to be represented in memory as a set of code units, and code units are then mapped to 8-bit bytes. The rules for translating a Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called a character encoding, or just an encoding. The first encoding you might think of is using 32-bit integers as the code unit, and then using the CPU’s representation of 32-bit integers. In this representation, the string “Python” might look like this: P y t h o n 0x50 00 00 00 79 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 6f 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 This representation is straightforward but using it presents a number of problems. 1. It’s not portable; different processors order the bytes differently. 2. It’s very wasteful of space. In most texts, the majority of the code points are less than 127, or less than 255, so a lot of space is occupied by 0x00 bytes. The above string takes 24 bytes compared to the 6 bytes needed for an ASCII representation. Increased RAM usage doesn’t matter too much (desktop computers have gigabytes of RAM, and strings aren’t usually that large), but expanding our usage of disk and network bandwidth by a factor of 4 is intolerable. 3. It’s not compatible with existing C functions such as strlen(), so a new family of wide string functions would need to be used. Therefore this encoding isn’t used very much, and people instead choose other encodings that are more efficient and convenient, such as UTF-8. UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings, and Python often defaults to using it. UTF stands for “Unicode Transformation Format”, and the ‘8’ means that 8-bit values are used in the encoding. (There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but they are less frequently used than UTF-8.) UTF-8 uses the following rules: 1. If the code point is < 128, it’s represented by the corresponding byte value. 2. If the code point is >= 128, it’s turned into a sequence of two, three, or four bytes, where each byte of the sequence is\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 4:\n",
      "between 128 and 255. UTF-8 has several convenient properties: 1. It can handle any Unicode code point. 2. A Unicode string is turned into a sequence of bytes that contains embedded zero bytes only where they rep- resent the null character (U+0000). This means that UTF-8 strings can be processed by C functions such as strcpy() and sent through protocols that can’t handle zero bytes for anything other than end-of-string markers. 3. A string of ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text. 4. UTF-8 is fairly compact; the majority of commonly used characters can be represented with one or two bytes. 5. If bytes are corrupted or lost, it’s possible to determine the start of the next UTF-8-encoded code point and resynchronize. It’s also unlikely that random 8-bit data will look like valid UTF-8. 6. UTF-8 is a byte oriented encoding. The encoding specifies that each character is represented by a specific sequence of one or more bytes. This avoids the byte-ordering issues that can occur with integer and word oriented encodings, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, where the sequence of bytes varies depending on the hardware on which the string was encoded. 3 1.3 References The Unicode Consortium site has character charts, a glossary, and PDF versions of the Unicode specification. Be prepared for some difficult reading. A chronology of the origin and development of Unicode is also available on the site. On the Computerphile Youtube channel, Tom Scott briefly discusses the history of Unicode and UTF-8 (9 minutes 36 seconds). To help understand the standard, Jukka Korpela has written an introductory guide to reading the Unicode character tables. Another good introductory article was written by Joel Spolsky. If this introduction didn’t make things clear to you, you should try reading this alternate article before continuing. Wikipedia entries are often helpful; see the entries for “character encoding” and UTF-8, for example. 2 Python’s Unicode Support Now that you’ve learned the rudiments of Unicode, we can look at Python’s Unicode features. 2.1 The String Type Since Python 3.0, the language’s str type contains Unicode characters, meaning any string created using \"unicode rocks!\", 'unicode rocks!', or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as Unicode. The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8, so you can simply include a Unicode character in a string literal: try: with open('/tmp/input.txt', 'r') as f: ... except OSError: # 'File not found' error message. print(\"Fichier non trouvé\") Side note: Python 3 also supports using Unicode characters in identifiers: répertoire = \"/tmp/records.log\" with open(répertoire, \"w\") as f: f.write(\"test\\n\") If you can’t enter a particular character in your editor or want to keep the source code ASCII-only for some reason, you can also use escape sequences in string literals. (Depending on your system, you may see the actual capital-delta glyph instead of a u escape.) >>> \"\\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}\" # Using the character name '\\u0394' >>> \"\\u0394\" # Using a 16-bit hex value '\\u0394' >>> \"\\U00000394\" # Using a 32-bit hex value '\\u0394' In addition, one can create a string using the decode() method of bytes. This method takes\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 5:\n",
      "an encoding argu- ment, such as UTF-8, and optionally an errors argument. The errors argument specifies the response when the input string can’t be converted according to the encoding’s rules. Legal values for this argument are 'strict' (raise a UnicodeDecodeError exception), 'replace' (use U+FFFD, REPLACEMENT CHARACTER), 'ignore' (just leave the character out of the Unicode result), or 'backslashreplace' (inserts a \\xNN escape sequence). The following examples show the differences: 4 >>> b'\\x80abc'.decode(\"utf-8\", \"strict\") Traceback (most recent call last): ... UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte >>> b'\\x80abc'.decode(\"utf-8\", \"replace\") '\\ufffdabc' >>> b'\\x80abc'.decode(\"utf-8\", \"backslashreplace\") '\\\\x80abc' >>> b'\\x80abc'.decode(\"utf-8\", \"ignore\") 'abc' Encodings are specified as strings containing the encoding’s name. Python comes with roughly 100 different encod- ings; see the Python Library Reference at standard-encodings for a list. Some encodings have multiple names; for example, 'latin-1', 'iso_8859_1' and '8859’ are all synonyms for the same encoding. One-character Unicode strings can also be created with the chr() built-in function, which takes integers and returns a Unicode string of length 1 that contains the corresponding code point. The reverse operation is the built-in ord() function that takes a one-character Unicode string and returns the code point value: >>> chr(57344) '\\ue000' >>> ord('\\ue000') 57344 2.2 Converting to Bytes The opposite method of bytes.decode() is str.encode(), which returns a bytes representation of the Unicode string, encoded in the requested encoding. The errors parameter is the same as the parameter of the decode() method but supports a few more possible handlers. As well as 'strict', 'ignore', and 'replace' (which in this case inserts a question mark in- stead of the unencodable character), there is also 'xmlcharrefreplace' (inserts an XML character reference), backslashreplace (inserts a \\uNNNN escape sequence) and namereplace (inserts a \\N{...} escape se- quence). The following example shows the different results: >>> u = chr(40960) + 'abcd' + chr(1972) >>> u.encode('utf-8') b'\\xea\\x80\\x80abcd\\xde\\xb4' >>> u.encode('ascii') Traceback (most recent call last): ... UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\ua000' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128) >>> u.encode('ascii', 'ignore') b'abcd' >>> u.encode('ascii', 'replace') b'?abcd?' >>> u.encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace') b'&#40960;abcd&#1972;' >>> u.encode('ascii', 'backslashreplace') b'\\\\ua000abcd\\\\u07b4' >>> u.encode('ascii', 'namereplace') b'\\\\N{YI SYLLABLE IT}abcd\\\\u07b4' The low-level routines for registering and accessing the available encodings are found in the codecs module. Im- plementing new encodings also requires understanding the codecs module. However, the encoding and decoding functions returned by this module are usually more low-level than is comfortable, and writing new encodings is a specialized task, so the module won’t be covered in this HOWTO. 5 2.3 Unicode Literals in Python Source Code In Python source code, specific Unicode code points can be written using the \\u escape sequence, which is followed by four hex digits giving the code point. The \\U escape sequence is similar, but expects eight hex digits, not four: >>> s = \"a\\xac\\u1234\\u20ac\\U00008000\" ... # ^^^^ two-digit hex escape ... # ^^^^^^ four-digit Unicode escape ... # ^^^^^^^^^^ eight-digit Unicode escape >>> [ord(c) for c in s] [97, 172, 4660, 8364, 32768] Using escape sequences for code points greater than 127 is fine in small doses, but becomes\n",
